# Horse Ranker Client

Horse Ranker provides Horseplayers and Handicappers with a quick Visual Comparison of who the Top Ranked Horses are in each race, and which ones to watch out for when trying to predict the outcomes of races. This Application helps Handicappers compare and contrast the strengths and weaknesses of each horse in a Race.
Users can select a specific Race at a Specific Racetrack and view a list of the horses in the race. Then, they can see the Rankings of each horse on a number of Ratings and Variables which Experts have agreed are relevant to deciding how each horse is likely to behave and perform in comparison to the other horses.
